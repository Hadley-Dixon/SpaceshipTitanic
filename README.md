Competition in the Spaceship Titanic contest on Kaggle.

- Impute values for missing data
- Handle categorical data correctly by doing one-hot encoding
- Split the labeled data provided by Kaggle into training and validation subsets
- Use the training data to train your decision tree model, and use the validation data to check how well your model is performing
- Experiment with the use of random forests and gradient boosting machines in addition to decision trees
