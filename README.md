 BSDS200 Homework 7

## Assignment Description

Your task in homework 7 is to compete in the Spaceship TitanicLinks to an external site. contest on Kaggle.

Be sure to impute values for missing data, and handle categorical data correctly by doing one-hot encoding.

You should split the labeled data provided by Kaggle into training and validation subsets. Use the training data to train your decision tree model, and use the validation data to check how well your model is performing. 

Experiment with the use of random forests and gradient boosting machines (to be discussed in class) in addition to decision trees. For full credit on this assignment, you must get a score of at least 77% on Kaggle. Upload to Canvas a screenshot showing your Kaggle score and leaderboard position along with your code.

Create a github repository for this project, and make commits to the github repo throughout development. When you upload your code to Canvas, you should also provide a link to your Github repo. (The link can be in a comment in the code.)
